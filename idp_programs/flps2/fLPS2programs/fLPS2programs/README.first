 fLPS version 2.0 annotates compositional biases in biological sequences 
(protein or DNA). These biases are SINGLE residue, MULTIPLE residue or WHOLE sequence. 

 There are 64-bit executable for MacOSX (Mojave 10.14.6) in the ./bin directory. 
Also, there are 64-bit ones for linux (GNU Linux Gentoo Base System release 2.6). 

 The source files are in the ./src directory. 
To compile all the programs, please use the 'make' command in the src directory.  

 To run: 
	./fLPS2  ...options... ...input_database_file... > ...output_file... 

Similarly, for the accessory programs (CompositionMaker and DomainFilter, see below). 
The input and output formats for these accessory programs are explained below. 

The help option for all programs is '-h'. 


RECOMMENDED PARAMETERS
====================== 

IT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE THE DEFAULT VALUES, TO FIND MORE EXTENDED BIASED REGIONS MADE FROM A 
COMBINATION OF MILD BIASES FOR SEVERAL RESIDUES, AS WELL AS SHORTER 'LOW-COMPLEXITY' TRACTS.
THESE VALUES WILL, HOWEVER, OFTEN MERGE SHORT CONSECUTIVE LOW-COMPLEXITY REGIONS INTO ONE LONG 
BIASED REGION.

TO FOCUS ON SHORT LOW-COMPLEXITY REGION ANNOTATION OR MASKING, THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE: 
      ./fLPS2 -t1e-5 -m5 -M25 ...input_file... > ...output_file... 


Options 
======= 
 The options are: 
	-h	To run and get help. This also shows some examples. 

	-v	For verbose runtime info. 

	-d	To include optional header and footer information in output files. 

	-s	calculate single-residue biases ONLY. 

	-n	specifies DNA sequence(s) (the default is amino-acid sequences). 

	-o	To choose the output format. This can be '-o short' (default), 
		'-o long', '-o masked' or '-o oneline'. 

	-m	To set the minimum window size. Must be in the range 5 to 1000. 
		Default is 15. 

	-M	To set the maximum window size. Must be in the range 5 to 1000, 
		and greater than minimum window size. Default is 500. 

	-t	The binomial p-value threshold for output (can be either decimal or exponential). 
		Can be set lower than the default (1e-03 for default -z option). 
		Can be <=1e-02 if '-z medium' is specified, and <=1e-01 if '-z thorough' (see below). 

	-r	inputs restriction list of amino acids for bias calculation. 

	-k	does not consider un-known residues (Xs for amino acids and Ns for nucleotides). 
              (These are still included in calculations of total residue amounts.) 
  
	-O	...FILENAME_PREFIX... allows for output to be sent to a unique file prefixed with 
		FILENAME_PREFIX.
		The parameters that are specified are included in the generated filename.  

	-D	indicates to read list of filtered domains from the name lines of the 
		FASTA-format sequence input file; this is only allowed for output format options 
		'-o short' and '-o long'; the domains should be in numeric order and not overlap. 
		If '-D excised', then the domains have been excised from the sequences; 
		if '-D masked', then the domains have been masked in the sequences. 

	-z   specifies the baseline precision of the bias calculation; there are three possibilities: 
		'fast' (the default, which specifies a baseline P-value threshold of 0.001, 
                   and a windowing step size of 3) 
		'medium' (the default, which specifies a baseline P-value threshold of 0.01, 
                     and a windowing step size of 2) 
		'thorough' (the default, which specifies a baseline P-value threshold of 0.1, 
                       and a windowing step size of 1) 

	-c	For specifying the name of an input background composition 
		file. The file ./examples/input/YEAST.fasta.COMPOSITION is an 
		example. To make such a file from a database: 
			./CompositionMaker (-n) ...input_database_file... 
                This program produces a composition file named after the input file, but with 
		the suffix .COMPOSITION appended. The option -n specifies DNA sequence. 

		There are two special values:
		 '-c domains': for background amino-acid frequencies calculated 
		 from a non-redundant set of protein domains (40% threshold for 
		 redundancy) from the SCOP database. This is the DEFAULT. 
		 '-c equal': for equal amino-acid frequencies as background 
		 (=0.05). 


Input and Output Files
====================== 
 Input files should be in FASTA format. Example input and output are in
 ./examples. 

 fLPS outputs information for LPSs (Low Probability Subsequences) for biases 
from a single residue or from multiple residues. Also, fLPS calculates biases 
for the WHOLE sequence. Very long sequences are curtailed to 100,000 residues 
length.   



	SEQUENCE_NAME        SEQUENCE_LENGTH      BIAS_TYPE       LPS_count    START    END      RESIDUE_COUNT       BINOMIAL P-value   SIGNATURE   CLASS

 The 'short' output format (tab-delimited columns) is: 
	SEQUENCE_NAME        Name of the sequence in the database 
	SEQUENCE_LENGTH      Length of sequence in residues 
	BIAS_TYPE            'SINGLE' for single-residue, 'MULTIPLE' for multiple-residue or 'WHOLE' for 
                            whole-sequence. 	
	LPS_count                 Counter for the LPS.
	START                Start residue position. 	
	END                  End residue position.
	RESIDUE_COUNT        Number of bias residues in the LPS. 
	BINOMIALP            Binomial P-value for the LPS.		
	SIGNATURE            List in curly brackets of the bias residues in 
                            order of precedence. 
	CLASS                The bias class. For proteins, the class labels that encompasses 
                            the smallest subset of residues corresponding to the bias signature 
                            is specified. These class labels are (in order of size):
                              amide:        glutamine, asparagine 
                              glx:          glutamine, glutamate 
                              asx:          asparagine, aspartate 
                              tiny_polar:   serine, cysteine
                              tiny_hydrophobic: alanine, cysteine, glycine 
                              polar_aromatic: tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine
                              negative:	  glutamate, aspartate
                              small_polar:  cysteine, aspartate, asparagine, serine, threonine 
                              positive:     lysine, arginine, histidine
                              small_hydrophobic: alanine, cysteine, glycine, threonine, valine 
                              aliphatic:    isoleucine, leucine, valine
                              aromatic:	  tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, histidine 
                              charged:      glutamate, aspartate, histidine, arginine, lysine 
                              tiny:         alanine, cysteine, glycine, serine 
                              small:        alanine, cysteine, glycine, serine, aspartate, 
                                            asparagine, proline, serine, threonine, valine 
                              polar:        tyrosine, tryptophan, threonine, serine, arginine, glutamine, 
                                            asparagine, lysine, histidine, glutamate, aspartate, cysteine 
                              hydrophobic:  alanine, cysteine, phenylalanine, glycine, histidine, 
                                            isoleucine, lysine, leucine, methionine, threonine, valine, 
                                            tryptophan, tyrosine

			       For DNA the bias class labels are: 
                            {A}|{T}, {G}|{C}, {AT}, {GC}, {AC}|{GT}, {AG}|{CT}, {ATC}|{ATG} and {ACG}|{CGT}. 

	ENRICHMENT           This is the proportion of the LPS made from biasing residues, divided by the 
                            total expected frequencies of the biasing residues (taken from the background 
                            composition). 

				 
 The 'long' output format is the short output format, plus the following
tab-delimited columns: 
	CORE_START        Start of a core region in the LPS that has the highest
                         concentration of bias residues. Core length is set to 15,
                         or to the minimum window size if it is smaller. 
	CORE_END          End of core region. 
	CORE_SEQUENCE     Sequence of core region. 
	NTERM_CONTEXT     N-terminal sequence context for the LPS sequence tract. 
                         This is up to 10 residues in length. Ends with '|' character.  
	LPS_SEQUENCE      Sequence tract of the LPS. 
	CTERM_CONTEXT     C-terminal sequence context for the LPS sequence tract. 
                         This is up to 10 residues in length. Starts with '|' character. 

 Optional header information that details the names of the columns, is displayed 
in output files by using the '-d' option. If '-o long' is specified, the '-d' option 
also causes display of footer information for each input sequence that summarizes the sequence length, 
the number of single-residue compositionally biased domains (#SINGLE), the number 
of multiple-residue compositionally biased domains (#MULTIPLE), and the number 
of whole-sequence compositional biases (#WHOLE). 

 The 'masked' output format is the FASTA format input file, but with the 
bias residues in LPSs masked by Xs (for protein), and Ns (for DNA). Only the SINGLE and 
MULTIPLE biases are masked. In the '>' name line, the LPSs are listed as: 
 START,END,{SIGNATURE},BINOMIALP. 
The default P-value threshold for masking can be set to any value â‰¤1e-05. 
 
The 'oneline' output format is a single-line summary for each sequence of the SINGLE 
and MULTIPLE biased regions detected. It is SEQUENCE_NAME and SEQUENCE_LENGTH followed by 
the LPSs listed as: START,END,{SIGNATURE},BINOMIALP. 


Further Examples
================  

./fLPS2 -vm 10 -M 1000 -c human.fasta.COMPOSITION human.fasta > ... 

   This will output verbose runtime info, use a minimum window size =10, 
   a maximum window size =1000, and background composition from the file 
   human.fasta.COMPOSITION. The input is human.fasta. The output will be 
   the short default. A larger M value enables detection of long multiple-residue 
   mildly biased regions that are missed with a small M. However, short low-complexity
   tracts may be merged into a longer biased region when a larger M is used. 

./fLPS2 -st 1e-12 -rFYW -c equal -o long human.fasta > ... 

   This will use a p-value threshold of 1e-12 and assume equal amino-acid 
   frequencies as background. The output will be long format. Only single-residue 
   biases will be output. The calculations are restricted to the aromatic residues
   F, Y and W.  

./fLPS2 -t1e-5 -m10 -M25 -o masked human.fasta > ... 
 
   This will use a p-value threshold of 1e-5 and use the default 'domains'
   amino-acid frequencies, with a minimum window size =10, and a maximum 
   window size =25, with masked sequence output. These parameter values 
   are suitable for annotating/masking short low-complexity sequences. 

./fLPS2 -z thorough -O human -D excised -o long human.fasta > ... 

   Here the file human.fasta will be analyzed using the most thorough baseline 
   precision. The output will be directed to an output file prefixed 'human', and 
   listing all of the command-line options. The program will read domains from the 
   FASTA-format '>' name line, assuming that they are excised domains. 

./fLPS2 -n -t0.000001 human.promoters.fasta > ... 

   The input is analyzed as DNA sequence with a binomial P-value threshold 
   of 0.000001 applied to the output. 


Accessory programs
================== 
    There are two accessory programs included in the package: CompositionMaker 
and DomainFilter. These are compiled when 'make' is invoked. 


CompositionMaker: 
----------------- 

    CompositionMaker can be used to make a composition file for the -c option, 
as shown above. 
    The INPUT file is a FASTA-format text file of sequences. 
    The OUTPUT file is in the standard composition file format for fLPS, with two columns:
residue types, and corresponding residue frequencies. 
    The OUTPUT file is named from the input file, but with the suffix 
'.COMPOSITION'. 

    The options for CompositionMaker are: 
 -h   prints help
 -v   prints runtime information
 -s   use a sample of the file (applies only to very large files greater than the current 
      size of the TrEMBL database, 2021);
      the file size is sampled to reduce it to the maximum allowed for this option;
      by default, the complete file is used.
 -n   specifies DNA sequence (default is protein)


DomainFilter: 
------------- 

    DomainFilter can be used to filter a database of sequences for domains. These 
can either be excised from the sequences or masked (with Xs for protein and Ns for DNA). 

    The INPUT file is the standard FASTA-format file, except that on the '>' name line, after
the name, there are specified the number of domains followed by a list of domains, e.g.:
    >sequence_name  3 50-75 domain1 104-184 domain2 211-233 domain3 
This specifies three domains from residues 50 to 75, 104 to 184 and 211 to 233. The domain 
names are 'domain1', 'domain2' and 'domain3' respectively. 

    The domains should be in numerical order and not overlap each other. 

    The OUTPUT file is a FASTA-format file. The domains on the '>' name line in the 
OUTPUT file have the same format for the '-D masked' option. 
 For the '-D excised' option, the output format is according to the following example: 
    >sequence_name  2 45,38 domA 120,54 domB 
Here, two domains have been excised from the sequence, namely domA and domB. In the shorter 
output sequence, the position immediately after the excision of domA is 45 and 38 residues 
have been excised. For domB, the position immediately after its excision is residue 120 
and domB was 54 residues long.  
    All fields in the '>' name line are separated by whitespace. 
    The OUTPUT file from DomainFilter can be used as input for fLPS2. 
The options for DomainFilter are: 
 -h   prints help
 -v   prints runtime information
 -d   prints header information in the output files
 -D   output specified with: 'excised' (default), or 'masked'
 -O   ...FILENAME_PREFIX... allows for output to be sent to a unique file prefixed with FILENAME_PREFIX
 -n   specifies DNA sequence (only necessary for the '-o masked' option, the default is protein)
